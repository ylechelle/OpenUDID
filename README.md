## IMPORTANT NOTE

Please read this blog post before considering using OpenUDID:

#### OpenUDID project notes

	IMPORTANT: IF YOU ARE GOING TO INTEGRATE OpenUDID INSIDE A (STATIC) LIBRARY,
	PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU REFACTOR THE OpenUDID CLASS WITH A PREFIX OF YOUR OWN,
	E.G. ACME_OpenUDID. THIS WILL AVOID CONFUSION BY DEVELOPERS WHO ARE ALSO
	USING OpenUDID IN THEIR OWN CODE.

#### Usage

	#include "OpenUDID.h"
	NSString* openUDID = [OpenUDID value];

#### Synopsis

OpenUDID is a drop-in replacement for the deprecated uniqueIdentifier property of the UIDevice class on iOS (a.k.a. UDID) and otherwise is an industry-friendly equivalent for iOS and Android, **and most recently Windows C# and Silverlight (see links above)**.

The agenda for this community driven project is to:
- Provide a reliable proxy and replacement for a universal unique device identifier. That is, persistent and sufficiently unique, on a per device basis.
- NOT use an obvious other sensitive unique identifier (like the MAC address) to avoid further deprecation and to protect device-level privacy concerns
- Enable the same OpenUDID to be accessed by any app on the same device
- Supply open-source code to generate and access the OpenUDID, for iOS and  Android
- Incorporate, from the beginning, a system that will enable user opt-out to match Apple’s initial intent

#### Context

If you’re not already familiar with UDID’s, it’s a critical piece of information used for analytics or CRM purposes. A developer could use a UDID as a means to track how much time a user spent in his free app before upgrading to the paid version. UDIDs are also helpful for tracking the source of a download when advertising on an ad network. This is a fairly universal need in a thriving ecosystem: developers need the traceability from clicks to downloads to ensure that they pay the right price for their promotion. Proper tracking and funnel conversion is what has made the web a better place, with healthy competition and quantifiable metrics.

In the wake of Apple’s decision to deprecate UDID, some ad networks have already introduced their own proprietary solutions or worse adopted a low hanging fruit like the MAC address. The main motivation here was to find a UDID replacement not owned by any single provider, not bound to the device in the hardware sense. This open source initiative is to enable a better solution for thousands of other mobile app developers.

##### Version History
